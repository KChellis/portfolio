          <p>When I'm not in class you can find me reading, singing karaoke, playing board games with friends or playing sports. I am very active and am involved in several sports. My favorites are: </p>
          <ol>
            <li><span>Kickball:</span> I have been playing for nine years in four different leagues. I'm usually on two to three teams at any given time. I will travel to tournaments in other cities a couple times a year.</li>
            <li><span>Bowling:</span> I have been bowling with the same team for 5 years. I'm not the best bowler but I still have a great time.</li>
            <li><span>Volleyball:</span> I have played for 3 years. I play indoors fall-spring, but in the summer we play outdoors on sand.</li>
            <li><span>Dodgeball:</span> I have been playing for 4 years. It is not my best sport and I only play occasionally now.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I also <em>love</em> to travel. I have visited 10 countries outside the US and have lived/worked in three of them. I hope to visit many more in my lifetime. I am a <strong>huge</strong> fan of the Portland Trail Blazers. I have season tickets and love to cheer my team on!</p>
