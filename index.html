          <p>Hi, I'm Kristen. I'm a Portland native who recenty decided to return to school to learn how to program. I'm relatively new to coding; I took a class in Java during college, but that was quite awhile ago. I am excited to see where the programming journey takes me. I am a quick learner and love to try new things.</p>

          <p class="Body">I received a Bachelor's degree in Joint Biology and Chemistry from Harvey Mudd College in 2008. Since then I have moved around in a wide variety of fields. I spent a few years working in wineries around the world. While exciting and rewarding, it was not a stable career so I returned to the US. I began working as a biometric technician for the US Citizenship and Immigartion Services(USCIS). I was promoted to backup site supervisor within a year. After four years I moved on to working as a personal assistant. I was unhappy in my career path and decided I needed a change. I decided to return to school to learn how to program.</p>

            <p>When I'm not in class you can find me reading, singing karaoke, playing board games with friends or playing sports. I am very active and am involved in several sports. My favorites are: </p>
            <ol>
              <li><span>Kickball:</span> I have been playing for nine years in four different leagues. I'm usually on two to three teams at any given time. I will travel to tournaments in other cities a couple times a year.</li>
              <li><span>Bowling:</span> I have been bowling with the same team for 5 years. I'm not the best bowler but I still have a great time.</li>
              <li><span>Volleyball:</span> I have played for 3 years. I play indoors fall-spring, but in the summer we play outdoors on sand.</li>
              <li><span>Dodgeball:</span> I have been playing for 4 years. It is not my best sport and I only play occasionally now.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I also <em>love</em> to travel. I have visited 10 countries outside the US and have lived/worked in three of them. I hope to visit many more in my lifetime. I am a <strong>huge</strong> fan of the Portland Trail Blazers. I have season tickets and love to cheer my team on!</p>
