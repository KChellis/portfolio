          <p class="Body">I received a Bachelor's degree in Joint Biology and Chemistry from Harvey Mudd College in 2008. Since then I have moved around in a wide variety of fields. I spent a few years working in wineries around the world. While exciting and rewarding, it was not a stable career so I returned to the US. I began working as a biometric technician for the US Citizenship and Immigartion Services(USCIS). I was promoted to backup site supervisor within a year. After four years I moved on to working as a personal assistant. I was unhappy in my career path and decided I needed a change. I decided to return to school to learn how to prpgram.</p>
